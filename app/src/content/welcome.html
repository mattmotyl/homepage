    <h1>Welcome to the Platform Data Primer</h1>
    <p>
      This website was built to accompany a lengthy handbook written by Matt Motyl, Jeff Allen, Spencer Gurley, and Sofia
      Bonilla at the Integrity Institute for the European Digital Media Observatory and published in August 2025. The goal is
      to provide a more accessible and interactive tool to help people who want to work with social media and search engine
      data, but may not have experience with what these platforms collect, how they store the data, how to access the data,
      and how to use the data to answer important research questions.
    </p>
    <p>
      The website mostly follows the chapter structure of the written handbook, but includes interactive components where you
      can search for data and practice writing data queries. You can choose to read this linearly, or jump around to the
      sections most useful to you.
