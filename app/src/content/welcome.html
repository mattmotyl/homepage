<h1>1. Introduction: Welcome to the Platform Data Primer</h1>
<p>
            This handbook translates a 35-page research report into an approachable, web-native guide. It walks you through what
            very large online platforms and search engines collect, how those data are structured, and how Article 40 of the
            Digital Services Act opens doors for researchers, investigators, journalists, and watchdogs who want to study online
            risks responsibly.

<h2>1.1 Article 40 at a glance</h2>
<p>
            Article 40 obligates Very Large Online Platforms and Search Engines (VLOPSEs) to provide qualified researchers with
            access to the datasets needed to evaluate systemic risks, mitigation efforts, and compliance with the Code of Practice
            on Disinformation. The Article formalizes a pathway for requesting data, establishes safeguards for privacy, and
            requires platforms to respond on clear timelines. Used well, this access enables independent verification of platform
            claims, early detection of emerging harms, and evidence-based policy debates.
          </p>
<p>
            Inside companies, engineers rely on expansive warehouses that log the moment-by-moment behavior of billions of
            accounts. Article 40 is a lever that lets outside experts peek behind that curtain. This primer prepares you to engage
            with platforms from a position of understanding, so that when access is granted you know exactly what to ask for and
            how to interpret what you receive.

<h2>1.2 How to use this primer</h2>
<p>
            The chapters mirror the structure of the original EDMO report. Each page contains the full narrative text, extended
            explanations, concrete examples, and downloadable resources. You can read linearly—from the foundations of what data
            exist, to how platforms transform them, to practical workflows and comparative case studies—or jump to the sections
            most relevant to your investigation via the table of contents.

<h3>Start with the data landscape</h3>
<p>
                Section 2 catalogues the six core data categories VLOPSEs collect and provides detailed examples drawn from
                internal documentation. It is designed to make opaque terminology feel concrete before you ever write a query.

<h3>Understand how platforms think</h3>
<p>
                Section 3 explains fact tables, dimension tables, and probabilistic scores in plain language. Visual walkthroughs
                illustrate how platform teams combine these ingredients to measure activity or detect risk.

<h3>Practice with real workflows</h3>
<p>
                Section 4 introduces typical research questions, provides annotated SQL examples, and offers a browser-based
                sandbox seeded with synthetic data. You can safely experiment with joins, filters, and aggregations before touching
                sensitive datasets.

<h2>1.3 Who this is for</h2>
<p>
            The Platform Data Primer is written for anyone seeking clarity about social media and search data—academic researchers,
            investigative journalists, civil society analysts, platform integrity teams, and public-interest technologists. No
            prior experience building data warehouses is required. Where the original PDF assumed familiarity with internal
            tooling, the web version adds supporting context, definitions, and examples so newcomers can follow along without
            feeling overwhelmed.
          </p>
<p>
            If you already work inside a platform, use these chapters to align cross-functional partners. If you are new to
            Article 40, follow the navigation sequentially: learn what exists, explore how it is stored, and then practice the
            analytical moves that transform raw tables into evidence.
