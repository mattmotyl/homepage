    <h1>Conclusion</h1>
    <p>
      Article&nbsp;40 opens unprecedented opportunities for independent researchers to interrogate platform systems. By understanding what data
      exist, how they are stored, and how to engage responsibly with APIs, you can translate that access into evidence that informs policy,
      journalism, and platform accountability.

      As you move from this primer to real datasets, revisit the chapters as needed. The tables, walkthroughs, and exercises are intentionally
      self-contained so you can refresh your memory before drafting a request or loading a new extract. Treat the interactive components as
      living notebooks—copy the queries, adapt them to your environment, and document what you learn.

          Use the checklists from the API chapter to outline authentication, storage, and governance requirements. Write down the specific
          datasets, time ranges, and risk hypotheses you will pursue.

          Share the “What Platforms Collect” and “How It’s Stored &amp; Used” chapters with your team so everyone adopts a common vocabulary before
          you submit Article&nbsp;40 requests or begin analysis.

          Return to the Practice page whenever you need to rehearse queries or prototype metrics. Refining your approach in the sandbox will save
          time when you work with production data.
