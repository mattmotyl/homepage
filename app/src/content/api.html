<h1>3. Preparing your workspace for Article 40 APIs</h1>
<p>
            Once a platform approves your Article 40 request, it typically provisions an isolated researcher workspace with API
            credentials, sample queries, and compliance documentation. This page translates the report’s guidance into a
            step-by-step setup checklist so you can start collecting data confidently—without needing to be a software engineer.
          </p>
<p>
            Each platform exposes slightly different endpoints, but the workflow is consistent: confirm the scope of the data,
            authenticate with the provided keys, store responses securely, and document every request you make. Treat the API as
            an audited environment—your ability to renew access depends on demonstrating good stewardship.

<h3>Know what you are getting</h3>
<p>
                Review the schema documentation before touching the API. Identify which tables or endpoints map to the variables
                you scoped in Section 2 and how often each payload is refreshed.

<h3>Decide where data will live</h3>
<p>
                Set up a secure storage location—an encrypted database, a restricted cloud bucket, or a researcher-managed
                server—so downloads do not linger on personal devices.

<h3>Assemble your team</h3>
<p>
                Coordinate with collaborators responsible for governance, legal review, and analysis. Assign owners for
                authentication, logging, and deletion workflows before data arrives.

<h2>3.1 Authenticating safely</h2>
<p>
            Platforms typically issue OAuth credentials, signed URL tokens, or SSH certificates. The safest pattern is to route
            authentication through a dedicated command-line client or secrets manager rather than embedding keys in scripts.
            Follow these steps for each new integration:
          </p>
<ol>
<li>Store the raw credentials in an encrypted vault (for example, Bitwarden, 1Password, or AWS Secrets Manager).</li>
<li>Use environment variables to inject tokens into your scripts or notebooks. Avoid committing them to version
              control.</li>
<li>Record the scopes each token grants. Article 40 access is often segmented by dataset; knowing which key unlocks
              which table prevents accidental overreach.</li>
<li>Test authentication in a sandbox endpoint first to confirm that your headers, user agent, and payload formatting
              match platform expectations.</li>
</ol>

<section class="section" id="api-secrets">
<h2>3.2 Managing keys and secrets</h2>
<p>
            Keys expire, and people change roles. Establish a rotation policy before you start downloading large extracts:
          </p>
<ul>
<li>Designate a credential owner who receives renewal reminders from the platform.</li>
<li>Set calendar holds for 30 days before token expiry to avoid downtime.</li>
<li>Use per-person tokens where possible so access can be revoked without disrupting the entire project.</li>
<li>Maintain a simple register (date issued, scope, owner, last used) stored alongside your governance documents.</li>
</ul>
<p>
            Many researcher environments ship with data handling agreements that specify retention limits. Align your deletion
            schedule with those obligations—store derived aggregates longer than row-level exports, and automate purges of staging
            files after you have loaded them into your analysis environment.
          </p>
</section>
<section class="section" id="api-limits">
<h2>3.3 Handling rate limits and quotas</h2>
<p>
            API responses often cap the number of records returned per request. Use pagination helpers provided in the
            documentation and design your extracts to respect the platform’s ceilings.
          </p>
<div class="table-wrapper">
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Platform</th>
<th>Typical quota</th>
<th>Recommended mitigation</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Meta Researcher Platform</td>
<td>10 concurrent jobs, 1M rows per day</td>
<td>Stage queries overnight; request higher burst limits for time-sensitive events.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>TikTok Research API</td>
<td>60 requests per minute</td>
<td>Batch content IDs and cache responses locally to avoid redundant pulls.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>YouTube Research Program</td>
<td>Quota units tied to endpoint complexity</td>
<td>Prioritize metadata endpoints before heavy video analytics exports.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</div>
<p>
            When you hit a limit unexpectedly, capture the response headers—the retry-after interval, request ID, and timestamp
            help platform support teams diagnose issues quickly. Document the workaround in your project log so colleagues can
            reproduce it.

<h2>3.4 Logging and documenting requests</h2>
<p>
            Treat every download like an experiment: track what you pulled, why you needed it, and how you stored it. A lightweight
            log can be as simple as a shared spreadsheet or as formal as a Git repository that stores YAML request manifests.
          </p>
<div class="card-grid">
<article class="card">
<h3>Minimum logging fields</h3>
<ul>
<li>Date and time of the request</li>
<li>Endpoint or table name</li>
<li>Filters and parameters applied</li>
<li>Files generated and their storage location</li>
</ul>
</article>
<article class="card">
<h3>Why it matters</h3>
<p>
                Logging protects you during audits, accelerates troubleshooting with platform contacts, and makes it easier to
                onboard collaborators midstream.
              </p>
</article>
<article class="card">
<h3>Share responsibly</h3>
<p>
                Provide summaries—not raw exports—when briefing partners. Link back to Article 40 agreements so everyone
                understands the boundaries around redistribution and publication.
