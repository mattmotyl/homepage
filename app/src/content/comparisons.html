<h1>8. Comparing API outputs with internal datasets</h1>
<p>
            Section 4 of the report examines how public APIs fall short of internal data when studying systemic risks. This page
            recreates that analysis while adding interactive views so you can isolate specific indicators. Understanding the gaps
            helps you articulate why Article 40 access is necessary and what additional fields you should request.
          </p>
<p>
            The examples use three framing questions:
          </p>
<ul>
<li>Can public APIs support research into particular harm types (misinformation, harassment, civic integrity)?</li>
<li>Do APIs expose the structural indicators enumerated in the DSA, such as content moderation capacity or recommender
              transparency?</li>
<li>How can open platforms like Mastodon serve as benchmarks for what “good” transparency looks like?</li>
</ul>
</section>

<h2>8.1 Research by harm type</h2>
<p>
            The report catalogs how TikTok, Facebook, YouTube, Google Search, and Mastodon cover different harm categories. Public
            APIs often reveal basic engagement counts but omit enforcement outcomes or demographic breakdowns. Use the controls below
            to switch between a table and visualizations.

            Scores translate to plain language in the table: <strong>Not available (0)</strong>, <strong>Partial coverage (1)</strong>,
            and <strong>Available with safeguards (2)</strong>. They mirror the assessment in the EDMO report and help you
            prioritize Article 40 requests.

<h2>8.2 Structural indicator coverage</h2>
<p>
            Many indicators cluster into themes: access to recommender logs, advertising transparency, civic integrity interventions,
            and moderation resources. Break down the table above by theme to see where each platform excels or lags.
          </p>
<details open="">
<summary><strong>Recommender transparency</strong></summary>
<p>Which datasets let researchers inspect ranking inputs, outputs, or shadow profiles?</p>
<ul>
<li>Facebook and TikTok provide partial internal recommender insights through researcher programs.</li>
<li>YouTube’s public API exposes watch history proxies but omits sensitive ranking features.</li>
<li>Mastodon makes ranking transparent because local timelines are chronological.</li>
</ul>
</details>
<details>
<summary><strong>Advertising and monetization</strong></summary>
<p>APIs often share creative assets but hide spend, targeting, or outcomes behind aggregate buckets.</p>
<ul>
<li>TikTok’s ad transparency reports are improving but still lag behind Facebook’s Ad Library.</li>
<li>Google Search publishes aggregate advertising integrity metrics twice a year.</li>
</ul>
</details>
<details>
<summary><strong>Integrity interventions</strong></summary>
<p>Internal dashboards track takedowns, demotions, and human review capacity—metrics rarely exposed publicly.</p>
<ul>
<li>Article 40 requests should specify which enforcement actions, appeal outcomes, and staffing levels you need.</li>
<li>Mastodon communities publish moderation logs voluntarily, offering a template for richer transparency.</li>
</ul>
</details>
</section>
<section class="section" id="example-3">
<h2>8.3 Mastodon as a reference point</h2>
<p>
            Mastodon is included in the report as a north star: federated servers document their policies, publish moderation
            decisions, and expose ActivityPub feeds that researchers can analyze without special permission. When negotiating Article
            40 access, point to Mastodon’s openness to illustrate that richer transparency is feasible without compromising privacy.
          </p>
<p>
            Consider pairing Mastodon data with Article 40 extracts to validate model performance or to estimate how policy
            interventions might scale to larger platforms. The comparison scores highlight which indicators Mastodon already meets so
            you can advocate for parity.
