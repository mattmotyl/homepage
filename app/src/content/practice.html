    <h1>Practice</h1>
    <p>
      Hands-on time cements the concepts from earlier chapters. This page offers structured exercises, reusable prompts, and a sandbox seeded
      with the same synthetic data used throughout the primer. Work through the scenarios in order or cherry-pick the questions that align with
      your research interests.

        <h3>Trace a systemic risk</h3>
        <p>
          Identify a delegated harm you care about—such as disinformation targeting a vulnerable community—and map the signals you would need
          from <code>fact_engagements</code> and the available dimensions. Document which filters isolate the population and which metrics reveal
          the pattern.

        <h3>Validate an internal claim</h3>
        <p>
          Platforms often cite high-level statistics in public updates. Recreate one of those statements using the sandbox (for example, “shares
          of long-form videos declined in Q1”). Pay attention to how you aggregate, and note any assumptions you must make along the way.

        <h3>Design a monitoring alert</h3>
        <p>
          Use the probabilistic score tables to define an alerting rule that would surface emerging risks. Consider thresholds, sample sizes, and
          how frequently you would rerun the query.

      The cards below keep the column names and descriptions within reach while you write queries. They mirror the sandbox schema exactly.

      Use the prompts to kick-start your exploration. Each button loads a query into the editor. Tweak the filters, add joins, or swap metrics to
      fit your scenario.
