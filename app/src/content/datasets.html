<h1>7. Landscape of public datasets</h1>
<p>
            Hundreds of academic labs, nonprofits, and investigative newsrooms share curated platform datasets outside of the
            official Article 40 channels. These resources can help you prototype research questions, validate your models, and
            build partnerships before you submit a formal request to a platform.
          </p>
<p>
            The list below spotlights well-maintained collections cited throughout the report and in Matt’s field work. Many link
            directly to raw data; others provide request forms or mirrors that you can download after a lightweight vetting step.

<h2>7.2 Tips for responsible reuse</h2>

<h3>Document provenance</h3>
<p>
                Note who collected the data, under what terms, and whether you must attribute or notify them when publishing
                findings. Many civic-tech projects rely on volunteer labor—acknowledging their work sustains the ecosystem.

<h3>Respect licensing</h3>
<p>
                Some repositories allow unrestricted reuse; others require you to keep derivatives non-commercial or to delete data
                after a set window. When in doubt, email the maintainers before redistributing.
              </p>

<h3>Cross-check with Article 40 access</h3>
<p>
                Use public datasets to refine your hypotheses and to test code. When you receive official platform data, compare
                metrics to ensure your transformations are working and to surface gaps in public transparency.
