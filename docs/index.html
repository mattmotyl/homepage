          <h2>Why this primer exists</h2>
          <div class="key-points">
            <p>
              Very Large Online Platforms and Search Engines (VLOPSEs) hold massive, complex datasets that describe how people use
              their services, how content spreads, and how moderation systems intervene. Article 40 of the DSA promises vetted
              access to these data, but most practitioners have never seen the underlying tables and documentation that make the
              numbers meaningful. This primer keeps the original report’s depth while adding navigation, examples, and interactive
              practice so you can:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Understand the categories of data platforms collect and why they matter for harm analysis.</li>
              <li>See how internal storage practices translate into the tables you may eventually query.</li>
              <li>Compare the coverage of public APIs against the richer internal datasets platforms use themselves.</li>
              <li>Build confidence by running SQL against realistic, Article 40-inspired sample tables right in your browser.</li>

          <h2>Abstract</h2>
          <p>
            This primer assists researchers studying systemic risks outlined in the Digital Services Act and the Code of Practice
            on Disinformation by explaining which platform datasets exist internally, which are exposed through transparency
            channels, and how the two relate. You will learn how platforms store and transform the information they collect, what
            variables are theoretically available through APIs or researcher programs, and how those variables map onto the harms
            enumerated in European policy. The ultimate goal is to help you use Article 40 access responsibly for the public good.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section class="section" id="introduction">
          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>
            VLOPSEs collect an extraordinary volume and variety of data. Even newly hired employees struggle to navigate the
            hundreds or thousands of tables inside a modern warehouse. Some organisations enforce strict schemas; others accrue
            tables organically over years of experimentation. Either way, making sense of the available variables is daunting.
          </p>
          <p>
            Civil society organisations, investigative journalists, academic researchers, and policy teams recognise that these
            datasets are indispensable for understanding the risks platforms pose to people, societies, and democracies. Access to
            both historical and real-time records is necessary to quantify the scale, causes, and dynamics of those risks—
            especially around critical civic moments such as elections.
          </p>
          <p>
            Article 40 of the Digital Services Act creates a path for vetted experts to study VLOPSE data. This primer equips you
            with the language, structure, and examples you will need once access is granted. Specifically, it expands upon the
            original report to:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Describe what types of data VLOPSEs collect about people, content, behaviour, networks, and paid media.</li>
            <li>Explain how those data are stored and transformed inside platform warehouses.</li>
            <li>Illustrate how the information powers product features, safety systems, and measurement pipelines.</li>
            <li>Provide examples of how to combine tables to answer concrete research questions.</li>
            <li>Review the transparency APIs and researcher programs currently on offer.</li>
            <li>Map available variables to the systemic risks defined in the DSA and Code of Practice.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Throughout, you’ll see the original report’s prose alongside new explanations, diagrams, and interactive exercises so
            that even readers who have never written SQL can follow along. The primer assumes no prior familiarity with platform
            data engineering—each chapter slows down to define jargon, clarify why specific variables exist, and show how to
            interpret them responsibly.

          <h2>Conclusion from the report</h2>
          <p>
            The EDMO handbook concludes that VLOPSEs collect far more data than their public APIs expose. Without access to the
            predictive variables and internal metrics platforms use to police harm, researchers cannot verify transparency
            reports or replicate platform findings. Article 40 is therefore essential for meaningful accountability.
          </p>
          <p>
            Until platforms share these critical datasets and document their methodologies, external observers must label content
            themselves and infer platform behaviour from partial disclosures. This primer exists to shorten that learning curve
            so researchers, journalists, and civil society experts can push for deeper transparency and use new access
            responsibly when it arrives.
