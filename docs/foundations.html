          <h1>2. What data do platforms collect?</h1>
          <p>
            Very large online platforms collect an enormous amount of data to keep their services running and to optimize the
            experience for users and advertisers. New employees often spend months learning the warehouse simply so they can find
            the right tables. This section reproduces the full text of the EDMO report so you can build the same intuition. Use it
            as a glossary: when a platform representative mentions “observed behavior” or “inferred scores,” you will know exactly
            what they mean and how the data are captured.
          </p>
          <p>
            Six broad categories encompass the majority of fields held by VLOPSEs: information people provide directly, data
            collected from their devices, records of behavior, signals coming from other users, inferences generated by machine
            learning, and data purchased or collected from outside the platform. The tables below detail each family, replicating
            the report’s examples so you can see the breadth of possible fields.
          </p>

          <h2>2.1 Data category reference</h2>
          <p>
            Each category mixes qualitative and quantitative variables. The same person might have hundreds of rows describing
            their actions over time, alongside a handful of descriptive attributes such as account creation date. Use the table to
            map the vocabulary used by platforms to the kinds of questions you want to investigate.
