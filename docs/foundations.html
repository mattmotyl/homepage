        <h1>Chapter 2 · What Data Do Platforms Collect?</h1>
        <p>
          Platforms collect a large amount of personal data, network data, advertising information, and engagement signals from
          their users. Some information is volunteered, some is inferred, and some is purchased from third parties. Not every
          platform gathers the same fields, but together these categories describe the universe of variables researchers may
          encounter when requesting Article 40 access.
        </p>

        <section class="section" id="six-categories">
          <h2>The six core categories</h2>
          <p>
            The primer groups platform-held data into six recurring categories. The original report lists concrete examples for
            each category; the table below adapts that inventory so you can quickly reference the breadth of what platforms store.

          <p class="table-note">
            The examples above come directly from the EDMO report. Platforms can usually produce many more variables inside each
            category, especially when they combine behavioural logs with predictive models.
          </p>
          <p>
            For a deeper dive into this topic, the report’s authors compiled a spreadsheet with detailed inventories of user,
            content, session, predictive, survey, and network variables. The supplemental explorer below mirrors that appendix so
            you can see how the categories translate into specific fields.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section class="section" id="data-uses">
          <h2>Why these data matter for research</h2>
          <p>
            Platforms rely on these signals to power machine learning systems, advertising optimisation, integrity enforcement,
            and product experimentation. Understanding which pieces exist—and where they originate—helps you request the right
            tables and interpret transparency disclosures. For example:
          </p>
          <div class="example-callout">
            <ul>
              <li>User-provided and behavioural data reveal what happened on the platform and who was involved.</li>
              <li>Signals received from other users and device telemetry capture community-level reactions and potential abuse.</li>
              <li>Inferences and purchased datasets often drive ranking, safety, or revenue decisions yet rarely appear in public APIs.</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <p>
            When you ask a platform to fulfil an Article 40 request, reference these categories explicitly. It shows that you
            understand the internal landscape and reduces ambiguity about the granularity you expect.
